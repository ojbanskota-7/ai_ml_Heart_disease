    "### Comparison of Task 1 and Task 2 Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**\n",
    "   - Task 1 (Single Feature: Cholesterol):\n",
    "     - Accuracy: *0.61111*\n",
    "     - Recall: *0.238095*\n",
    "     - F1-score: *0.3225*\n",
    "     - Precision : *0.5*\n",
    "   - Task 2 (Multiple Features: All variables):\n",
    "     - Accuracy: *0.9074*\n",
    "     - Recall: *0.8571*\n",
    "     - F1-score: *0.7880*\n",
    "     - Precision : *0.9*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which model performs better and why**\n",
    "   - Task 2 generally performs better because it **uses all relevant features**, capturing more relationships that influence heart disease risk.  \n",
    "   - Task 1 is simpler but limited: it only considers **Cholesterol**, so many patterns are missed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Effect of adding more features**\n",
    "   - **Accuracy** usually increases because the model has more information to make correct predictions.  \n",
    "   - **Recall** may improve for the positive class (presence of disease) because the model can detect subtle patterns.  \n",
    "   - However, adding irrelevant or noisy features could sometimes hurt generalization (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Trade-offs**\n",
    "   - **Single Feature (Task 1)**:\n",
    "     -  Easy to interpret and visualize (coefficients show clear effect).  \n",
    "     -  Lower performance, misses interactions between features.\n",
    "   - **Multiple Features (Task 2)**:\n",
    "     -  Higher accuracy and better detection of heart disease.  \n",
    "     -  Harder to interpret; coefficients are harder to explain when there are many features.  \n"
